### COVID-19 Vaccine Roll Out
An end-to-end data story that asks: “Among the world’s 20 most-populous countries, who rolled out COVID-19 vaccines first—and does domestic biotech manufacturing capacity explain the speed?”
Using open data from Our World in Data, I built an interactive Plotly dashboard and a clean CSV that reveal:

* United States started first (13 Dec 2020)
* Countries with a domestic manufacturing score ≥ 2 began vaccination within 6 weeks of global launch; score-0 nations waited 2–3 months
* Germany & Mexico closed the primary-dose gap fastest after the US
* The repository includes the full Python notebook and an HTML dashboard you can open in any browser.
